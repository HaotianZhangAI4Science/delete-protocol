This protocol is used for performing structural modification of ligands with Delete method. 



## Define Replacement

### Discover patterns with pharmacophore modeling. 

## Use Delete

Download the Delete and follow the guildline to build the surf_maker environment and delete environment.

Scenario: if you have a target on which to design, and you have a prepared fragment. You can generate a series possible modifications using Delete. 

```python
python gen_all_epoch_to_1_target.py
```

Then you would get a series of modified molecules. 

## Filter the molecules 

### QSAR

### Mol Prop

### Docking 

### MM-PBSA

### FEP
